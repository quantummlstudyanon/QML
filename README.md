# QML

**Quantum Machine Learning (QML) Study Repository**

This repository contains notebooks, scripts, and resources for implementing and exploring quantum SVMs, comparing them to classical models, and supporting ongoing study in quantum-enhanced machine learning.

## Overview

This repository includes:

- **Jupyter notebooks** for QML experiments and theory
- **Scripts** for training and evaluation
- **Notes and summaries** for quantum ML study

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quantummlstudyanon/QML.git
cd QML
```

### 2. Set up the environment

> **Note**: This project requires **Python 3.11 or earlier** for compatibility with quantum libraries such as Qiskit and PennyLane.

Option 1 - using **venv**:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Option 2 - using **conda**:

```bash
conda create -n qml python=3.11
conda activate qml
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Launch notebooks

Start the Jupyter notebook server:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then navigate to the `notebooks/` folder in your browser interface and open the desired notebook to run cells sequentially.
